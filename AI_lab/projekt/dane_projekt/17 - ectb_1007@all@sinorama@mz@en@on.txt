Chinese New Year 's Eve - Doing it the Modern Way
With celebrations for the long - anticipated start of the year 2000 barely over , Chinese people began busily preparing to mark another new year .
" Spring Festival , " as it is known , brings a longer break from work - compared with Western New Year - and is an altogether more meaningful occasion for the Chinese .
Amid today 's sweeping tide of modernization , Spring Festival is probably the only annual occasion left with a truly " Chinese " flavor .
So how do people celebrate Chinese New Year nowadays ?
How much of the ancient form of the festival survives , and what new elements have been added in our time ?
Under the crisp and pleasant skies of late December , Mrs. Pu , a woman in her late fifties who lives in a military dependents ' village in Taoyuan , hastens to place her order for 40 catties -LRB- 24 kg -RRB- of streaky pork .
When the meat arrives she chops it into one - catty strips , then steeps these in a marinade of dry - fried star anise and other spices , mixed with rock sugar , salt and Gaoliang liquor .
After several days of preparation , the result is larou , or end - of - year cured meat .
There 's still over one month to go before Spring Festival , but as Mrs. Pu explains : " It takes a fairly long time to make larou , and you have to make allowance for the weather .
It 's best to get going early so that you have the meat ready to give out to friends and relatives in time for New Year . "
Her ever - popular larou is made in accordance with a time - tested recipe .
She adds the spices in their special proportions , and then seals the meat in a vat to marinate for six days so as to ensure a full flavor .
After being removed from the vat the strips are slowly smoked over a mixture of sugarcane bark , charcoal , orange peel and rice husks , until they have acquired a lovely luster and exude a delicious aroma .
Finally the cured strips are hung out for two or three days in the sun to draw off excess fat .
For Mrs. Pu and her husband , the traditional lunar new year has more significance than the Western version .
It provides the opportunity for making food in the traditional style of their home region , much of which they give to others , and also brings the whole family together for an eagerly awaited celebration .
New Year 's Eve dinner is the highlight , with three generations - more than ten hungry mouths - gathered for the feast .
" We need at least ten New Year dishes , " says Mrs. Pu .
In addition to servings of chicken , duck , fish and pork , they always have some of the specialties of her husband 's home region , Anhui Province in mainland China , including yuanzi meatballs -LRB- minced pork blended with chopped spring onion , ginger , garlic and rice noodles , rolled in cornstarch flour and deep - fried -RRB- .
Other favorites such as pearl balls -LRB- meatballs wrapped in sticky rice -RRB- , pork knuckle in brown sauce , and mixed vegetables , dishes that Mr. and Mrs. Pu like to make for themselves and others all year round , also appear at the table , all cooked with extra special attention for New Year .
In fact , preparations for the feast begin three or four days before the event itself .
Slowly warming up
The timing of Chinese New Year is determined by the traditional lunar calendar and marks an important transition , the point when Winter gives way to Spring .
In China , a country founded on farming , there has always been a tangible link between seasonal changes and the pattern of agricultural production .
As this link was absorbed into people 's lives it gave rise to the rituals of rural existence , the most prominent of which marked the conclusion of the natural cycle at the end of every year .
Thus New Year became the most important of all traditional festivals , symbolizing endless rebirth and the continuation of the natural cycle .
While underpinning the annual cycle of festivals and the daily routine of the people , New Year also , through its religious - type observances , came to express Chinese people 's ideas about life , nature , and clan society .
The attitudes and lifestyles of the Chinese are also given full expression through the various activities that take place during the holiday .
Traditions such as sweeping the house to " drive out the old and bring in the new , " venerating the gods , making offerings to ancestors , having the whole family eat together and stay up late on New Year 's Eve , calling on friends and relatives on New Year 's day , and - for married women - visiting their parents on the following day .
In spite of the changes wrought by modernization , which make it impossible for the New Year to be celebrated in exactly the way that it used to be , and regardless of the simplifications that have taken place , Spring Festival remains the longest and most important holiday in the calendar .
It is , as ever , a time of plenty and of family reunion - a great occasion for everyone .
Homeland of the soul
Food is an obsession with the Chinese , and never more so than at New Year when virtually every family - like Mrs. Pu 's in Taoyuan - enjoys one or two dishes prepared to their own " private " recipe , plus other edible treats with special symbolism .
For most people , dishes such as these are forever bound up with the spirit of New Year .
Writer Lin Wen - yueh has penned numerous articles on the culture of food and drink in recent years , including a vignette -LRB- from her collection of essays Epicurean Notes -RRB- about New Year with the family , entitled " Luobo Pudding . "
" When the Chinese do New Year , one type of specialty is indispensable : New Year pudding . . . .
However , as China covers such a vast territory , this pudding comes in different versions according to region .
For example , people in the belt south of the Yangtze River generally eat " Ningpo pudding , " made from sticky rice shaped into broad bars , while those hailing from Guangdong and the Southern Fujian region go for luobo pudding , made from a mixture of shredded white turnip -LRB- luobo -RRB- and long - grain rice .
As Lin writes : " Although my family moved around a lot when I was little , Mother was quite stubborn about personally taking charge in the kitchen every New Year to make luobo pudding for the whole family .
So when we spent New Year in Shanghai , we did n't have Ningpo pudding like the rest of the people there , and when we were in Tokyo we did n't have the " mirror cake " that they like in Japan .
No matter where we were , it was always luobo pudding for us . "
Lin recalls that there were so many mouths to feed at New Year that they had to use two or three large bamboo steamers to make the puddings .
Come New Year , the children were always attracted by the unusually busy atmosphere in the kitchen , and loved running in and out to check on what was going on , meanwhile getting under everyone 's feet .
Lin 's mother was n't too happy about this , and the kitchen helpers would impatiently wave the kids away , calling : " Shoo ! Shoo ! Go outside and play ! "
However , as Lin grew up , her mother would call her and the other girls to her side to watch and help out .
She said : " Follow closely , now .
One day I 'll be gone , and you 'll have to do this all by yourselves . "
Making luobo pudding is a demanding process and requires plenty of ingredients .
Nowadays there 's no need to wait for New Year - the pudding can be sampled throughout the year at Hong Kong - style dimsum restaurants or bought readymade in the market .
But come the last month in the lunar calendar , Lin Wen - yueh still prepares several luobo puddings the old - fashioned way , so that her family and friends can enjoy New Year pudding " the way mama used to make it . "
Difficult time of year
Nowadays it is n't so easy to recreate the elaborate New Years of the past .
The speeded - up , stripped - down pace of modern life has reduced the event in scale , and people now regard New Year in different ways according to how it fits in with their lives .
Surveys show that among the Chinese , New Year is ranked as one of the most stressful facets of life .
A tale from the past shows how New Year has always been a source of financial pressure for families .
During the Ming dynasty -LRB- 1368 - 1644 -RRB- , a Fuzhou prefectural magistrate named Cai Junmo issued an order for every family in the district to light seven lanterns for Lantern Festival -LRB- the 15th day of the first lunar month -RRB- .
One of the residents of the prefecture , a man named Chen Lie , satirized the magistrate 's order with a verse that he painted on a large lantern :
" In the homes of the rich , lanterns are as plentiful as rice in the granary /
In the homes of the poor , a single lantern reduces fathers and sons to misery /
The carefree magistrate may not be aware of this /
And simply complains that the music is n't good enough . "
In the Haifeng area of Guangdong Province , there is a saying to describe the hardship that the holiday brings for the poor - whom the festival often relieved of a whole year 's worth of painstakingly accumulated surplus : " Those with money celebrate New Year ; those without money get stripped bare . "
This was especially so given that the " close of the year " was also the time when creditors turned up to claim their dues and " close " their accounts .
Chen Chih - fan , the scientist and well - known essayist , once described how he , as the eldest son in a poor family , used to spend the days before New Year writing and selling spring couplets in the market , so as to help his father pay off debts and buy goodies for his siblings .
On account of his skill at calligraphy , Chen spent many a New Year in this fashion .
As a successful scholar he was later able to recall this episode with pride , yet the bitterness and hurt still showed through in his words .
Tough work , year after year
On top of economic pressures , New Year , for many housewives , brings the added burden of endless household chores .
In the past , this meant a nonstop round of house cleaning , making pudding , doing the New Year shopping and making new clothes , starting from the 8th day of the 12th lunar month .
There was also the matter of performing the prescribed observances to heaven and earth , the ancestors , the kitchen god and various other deities .
Things are simpler nowadays , but putting together a New Year dinner to fill the bellies of everyone in the family still presents an enormous culinary and physical challenge .
For those who live far from the parental home , there 's the added trial of transport conditions - congested roads , fully - booked trains and airplanes - to foil the plans of all who would hurry home in time to spend New Year 's Eve with the clan .
And if you live in a large family with plenty of old folk and youngsters - all expecting red envelopes of cash - your hard - earned year - end bonus may well be gone by the time New Year is over .
In recent years , New Year has increasingly shown up on the agenda of the women 's movement .
Many women now object to the tradition of spending New Year 's Eve with the family of their spouse , rather than at the homes of their own parents , and point out that this is one of the nasty little legacies of a patriarchal society , something which goes against the modern principle of sex equality .
" I 'm an only daughter , and my father has passed away , so I really hate leaving mom to spend New Year 's Eve all alone . "
" When we go over to my husband 's family , it 's nothing but nonstop cleaning and cooking ! "
These are some of the many complaints expressed by women writing to the letters pages in the press .
For many people , the solution is to book a holiday abroad at this time of year so as to avoid the whole occasion .
Others opt to splash out on dinner at a hotel or restaurant so that no - one has to worry about getting everything ready .
For modern , urban families , these are two of the fashionable and convenient new ways of surviving New Year .
A bittersweet evening
" The most scary thing is the deep - seated clan mentality of the Chinese , " says Li Yuan , an author known for his writings on the topic of family .
" It can tangle the relationship between parents and children into a never - unraveled web of pain and intimacy - which does n't always make for happy family reunions . "
No wonder New Year 's Eve is frequently a time of generational conflict .
Li describes the case of his own family .
His mother and father came from Hakka backgrounds on the mainland , and as clan identity is strongly emphasized in Hakka culture , his father used to require all his children and grandchildren to be at the family home for dinner on New Year 's Eve .
Concerned about the burden on the old couple , Li persuaded them to hold the annual get - together at his house , with dinner prepared by his wife and sisters .
Striving valiantly to create a party atmosphere , Li took a leaf out of " Old Laizi 's " book , -LRB- Old Laizi was a legendary paragon of filial piety who acted like a child well into his seventies just to keep his parents amused -RRB- , dreaming up little pranks with the help of his children .
For example , they gave mischievous names to each of the dishes served for New Year 's Eve dinner , like " Dongfang the Invincible 's Chopped - off Willy , " " The Flower of Guanyin 's Slender Waist , " and " Sea Cucumber , Squid and Meatballs - a Three - in - one World . "
" The mood of good cheer and togetherness at New Year can indeed leave some heart - warming memories , " acknowledges Li Yuan .
" But the occasion can also dredge up less pleasant associations from the past . "
During New Year 's Eve six years ago , Li 's father could n't stop himself getting worked up , in spite of the family 's best efforts to keep the mood light .
Dinner was nearly over when the old fellow demanded that his children come to his side , and announced : " I want to square up accounts with every one of you , each in turn . . . . "
He began to lecture them about how hard he had struggled in his youth to bring them all up , recalling every little incident as though it were yesterday .
He broke down in tears once he got onto the things that had hurt him , and after that there was no calming him down .
" He had absolutely no idea that his children all had to swallow their own share of hurt and disappointment while growing up , but never complained to him .
Now each of them felt afresh the grievances of childhood , and began to strike back , one after another . "
Li described the ensuing scenario :
" Some wheeled out their heavy artillery and some used the machine - gun approach .
Cannon and gunfire rang out on that cold rainy night , while tears flowed and fireworks exploded .
The old bruiser , nearly 80 years old , was struck speechless .
His authority lay in tatters , long since torn down by his adult offspring .
He 'd taken so many hits by then that he was riddled with bullet - holes .
He slumped miserably back into his chair , lips quivering as if to speak , but no words coming from his mouth . "
The evening ended in tears and awkwardness .
" Our family was quite poor when we were growing up , " says Li , " and Father suffered plenty of frustrations on our behalf .
He thought that we had n't properly repaid him once we had grown up , and felt quite bitter about it .
But he did n't realize that we too , growing up in such circumstances , faced hardship and frustration .
Like my elder sister who had to work her way through school .
Everyone had something to get off his chest .
It all got quite heated . "
Li felt depressed and guilty about the way the evening turned out .
When he went over to his parents house the next day to pay his New Year respects , he asked his children to help smooth things over , and he scrubbed clean the toilet bowl as penance .
Li Yuan 's father passed away the year before last .
His mother , more relaxed about things than her husband , was n't concerned about doing a New Year 's Eve dinner , so last year the family cancelled the tradition .
" Mom decided to take a trip abroad .
My family and I like the unusual quiet that descends on Taipei 's streets for the period of the festival , and since we did n't want to make any special arrangements , we just stayed home and had a good rest . "
A quiet New Year
" What we are missing , " says author Yang Hsiao - yun , " is a way of bringing new meaning into the old tradition , a way of spending New Year that suits ordinary people . "
Yang 's strongest association with New Year is of going to do the New Year 's shopping with the grown - ups when she was little .
" We were always very thrifty in those days , without extra cash for new things .
New Year was the only time when we got to bring bulging bags and packages back to the house .
Just the sight of all those treats - chicken , duck , fish and pork ; candies and cookies ; fruits and soda drinks - was a thrill for us .
Then there were all the New Year presents , like new clothes , shoes and hats .
At New Year our parents liked to dress the girls in red from head to toe , for good luck and for fun .
We looked as if we 'd been dipped in a tub of haw juice . "
In spite of the excitement that she remembered feeling , as a child , about getting to wear new clothes and new hats , Yang later began to question this way of spending New Year .
She felt especially turned off by the orgy of consumption connected with the festival .
" It was only after I had kids of my own that I began to rethink the importance of New Year - partly out of nostalgia , and partly to pass the tradition on to my children , " admits Yang .
Nowadays she emphasizes just three aspects of the occasion : getting the family together , enjoying the festive spirit , and having a rest .
" At one point we tried the fashionable thing , taking the family away for a vacation , but being abroad we really missed that festive flavor . "
Eventually she returned to the traditional form , making the New Year 's Eve dinner herself , and always including a Manchurian - style pickled cabbage hotpot prepared just the way her parents used to do it .
-LRB- Her father hailed from Liaoning Province in mainland China . -RRB-
" With life as busy and stressful as it is the rest of the year , we decided to drop the formal New Year gathering .
Instead , we now spend the time relaxing at home , doing whatever we fancy , be it sitting quietly and reading , listening to music , going on an outing , or talking about the ups and downs of the past year .
Or we might invite a couple of close friends round to reminisce about old times .
It 's quiet , and it 's really satisfying .
" On the other hand , " continues Yang , " the end of the year can also serve as a reminder for people to review their past actions . "
She always sets aside a little time for herself on New Year 's Eve to do just this .
As midnight approaches , and with all the household chores taken care of , Yang settles down to quietly reflect on how she has grown during the past twelve months , and to draw up her personal " profit and loss sheet " for the year .
" It 's nothing to do with money , " she stresses .
" It 's a way of measuring whether I 've achieved my objectives , in my work and in my personal maturity .
I ask myself what my bad habits are .
It 's a kind of New Year 's Eve dish for the spirit ! "
Yang feels that if we redefine New Year in terms of its contemplative and spiritual meaning , rather than just regarding it as an occasion for feasting and partying , then we can better sense how time passes , and see that another phase in our working lives has been completed .
In this way we can make our wishes for the year ahead , setting goals for work and for personal growth , without getting maudlin about time 's passage and the meaninglessness of it all .
For the Chinese , the family is the basic unit for celebrating New Year , but the family , like society , has been changing in recent years .
Couples whose children have grown up and moved out , face the " empty nest syndrome , " while many individuals , particularly among the elderly , live on their own .
However , for people like these , and for the homeless , there are still ways of enjoying " a good get - together " at New Year .
All together now
One month before last year 's Chinese New Year , artist Wang Cheng - liang placed some articles in the press seeking others like himself - single people with nothing special to do on New Year 's Eve - to register for a New Year 's Eve dinner and party at his studio .
You did n't have to know anyone else going .
Plenty of people took up the offer , and the party was packed .
For Wang , it was the most fun he 'd ever had at New Year .
Lin Wen - yueh moved to California once her children had grown up and started families of their own , so she can no longer spend New Year with her immediate family .
But her enthusiasm for the festival has n't waned .
" Now I spend New Year with friends who are in similar circumstances to me .
Each of us brings a dish for the meal , and makes his own contribution .
It 's all very relaxed . "
For Lin , friendship is as heart - warming as family ties .
" New Year is part of our shared cultural and ethnic memory .
It 's a homeland of the soul for every one of us .
The external form may have changed , but the memory of some inner yearning , that sense of needing to belong , these are things that can never change . "
For those often - overlooked old folk and street people , there are special New Year dinners organized by private welfare groups , enabling them to share in the human warmth of the occasion .
Last year the Buddha 's Light International Association organized New Year 's Eve dinners in the north , center and south of Taiwan , which were attended by more than 5,000 old folk who live alone .
This year they are repeating the exercise , and are including a special event in Nantou County to bring some warmth and love to elderly survivors of the 9 / 21 earthquake there .
Another group , the Creation Social Welfare Foundation - which is well known for its work with street people and for taking care of vegetative - state patients - runs an annual New Year 's Eve party for homeless people .
" Giving and serving , these too form part of the meaning and purpose of New Year . "
The Venerable Yung Fu of the Buddha 's Light International Association hopes that today 's well - fed , well - clothed people of Taiwan can extend the warmth and love of their own families out to society at large , and especially to those most in need of attention , so as to widen and elevate the meaning of New Year .
It is no surprise that amid the hectic pace of modern life , some of the relaxed good fun has gone out of Chinese New Year .
But as a custom that has been part of the culture for so long , it continues to occupy a unique position in our hearts and lives .
What remains to be seen is how well we can adapt and update this ancient tradition to fit the changing needs of modern society .
