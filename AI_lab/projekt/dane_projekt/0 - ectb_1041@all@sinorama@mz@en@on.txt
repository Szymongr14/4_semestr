Bands Make Their Mark
-LRB- Eric Lin / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
The band tradition in Taiwan dates back to the time when the US military forces had bases on the island .
It was de rigueur to have a live band at all the bars frequented by American soldiers .
Veteran radio program host Tao Hsiao - ching recalls that when she wanted to organize a concert in the 1960s , there were already a lot of bands to choose from .
Apart from bands that worked the bars , there were others that went into the pop music scene .
One example was " The Five Flower Petals , " a five - girl band .
Lead singer Tsai Mi - mi had a very sweet voice -LRB- " Mama ! Mama ! Give me a guitar . . . . " -RRB- , and she was nice looking too .
But the Flower Petals were n't so much a band as a collection of teen idols .
A number of bands appeared in the 1960s that sang mostly Western songs .
Their lead singers sometimes got noticed by music companies and became famous singers .
The most famous ones were Huang Ying - ying , Julie Su , Kao Ling - feng , and Billy .
Campus bands across the island began writing their own music and lyrics in the 1970s .
Notable examples include The Travelers and Wood Guitar .
These bands , and the folk music they sang , reigned supreme on into the 1980s until the sudden rise of a number of extremely popular rock bands .
Some of the more notable 1980s rock bands were The Chiu Chiu 's , The Red Ants , and several bands featuring Hsueh Yueh .
Looking back on the origins of band music , Tao Hsiao - ching attributes its popularity to the albums of Lo Ta - yu and the fact that many proprietors of pubs and other establishments that hire live music started putting emphasis on " the band sound . "
The social commentary in the lyrics of these songs also elicited a strong response .
According to Wang Tsu - shou , a senior reporter at Minsheng Daily , " Youth bands were so popular , we thought for a while that we had entered into a sort of ' Age of the Band , ' but it turned out to be short - lived . "
The high tide of band music spurred the formation of many student bands , and KHS Musical Company used to organize an annual campus rock band competition where many singers and bands got their first big break , including Chang Yu - sheng , Tai Cheng - hsiao , and The Orient Express .
The latter , which was composed entirely of good - looking guys , was the only group that released an album together after going professional , however , while Chang and Tai opted to strike out on their own as solo artists .
As Tao Hsiao - ching explains , band music only appealed to a limited market , and it was very expensive to keep a band operating .
For these reasons , music companies preferred to sign up only the lead singers .
This remained the prevailing pattern in the industry from Kao Ling - feng 's time through the appearance of Chang Yu - sheng .
Then China , Harlem Yu -AMP- Ding Jian Pai Dang , Baboo , and Wu Bai and his band all released albums in 1992 .
The music world was electrified , and people began talking once again about the arrival of " the Age of the Band , " but the market for this music was still weak .
The only one of these albums that became a big hit was Harlem Yu -AMP- Ding Jian Pai Dang , and this album 's strong sales were due in large part to the fame of the singer , Harlem Yu .
Wu Bai , in the meantime , held fast to his rock style and struggled into the mid-90s .
Then , playing to small pub audiences , he finally hooked up with a band called China Blue and rocketed to immense popularity as locally rooted Taiwanese culture began to take on a certain cachet .
The success of Wu Bai -AMP- China Blue has rested primarily , however , on Wu 's reputation as a singer and songwriter , while the band has played more of a supporting role .
Amidst this rebirth of youth bands in the 1990s , there has been a very interesting undercurrent .
Groupie , LTK Commune , and a raft of other underground bands have quietly been carving out a niche for themselves in the pub scene .
Both mainstream and non-mainstream music companies -LRB- such as Friendly Dog and Crystal Records , respectively -RRB- have begun to release their albums , thus giving a small number of enthusiasts ample opportunity to keep up to date with the unde
