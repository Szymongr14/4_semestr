Final think evening -- on this Halloween , witchcraft .
At least 500,000 Americans now describe themselves as witches , in that they practice witchcraft in one part of the country or another .
Many find what witches do inoffensive , but not so in part of Louisiana .
Peggy Wehmeyer reports on what is acceptable in New Orleans is anything but not far away .
When it comes to spirituality , New Orleans is a city of contrasts .
Attend Mass on Sunday morning , visit fortune tellers and voodoo queens by noon .
But practices that go mostly unnoticed in New Orleans are causing a stir because 70 miles down the road in a conservative bayou town , a home to more than 100 churches and a coven of witches .
The main belief in witchcraft is harm none .
Not everyone in town thinks these witches are harmless .
Many fear they are introducing dangerous spirits into the community .
The church is gainst everything we stand for as a Christian nation .
We want to stand up and say not in our community .
We want to say absolutely not .
In an effort to end witchcraft , a resident filed a complaint against the witches using an old law that forbids fortune - telling .
The witches believe that through these rituals and the reeged of Tarot cards , their gods and goddesses will direct their futures .
Local officials sent a detective to the coven to photograph the evidence .
All of a sudden , we get a knock on the door .
He says , I 'm going to turn these pictures in to my superiors and they 're going to determine if it is fortune - telling .
If it is , I 'll arrest you .
The ACLU is trying to abolish that threat .
The group is now suing Louisiana on behalf of the witches to abolish the 1928 law it considers unconstitutional .
We do n't protect the wicked free speech right , then the Baptists and Catholics ' free speech right is at risk .
They say they do n't have a case against the witches but they fear the witch - hunt will continue until the fortune - telling law is off the book for good .
