Chinese New Year in the Southern Hemisphere
-LRB- by Lin Ying - hua , Auckland , New Zealand / tr. by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
It was the middle of summer in New Zealand , and the time for celebrating Chinese New Year .
There are plenty of Asian immigrants on the east side of Auckland , and if New Zealanders can have Christmas on a sweltering hot day , then why should n't we Asians do something to mark our traditional New Year ?
Thus it was that the United Asian Association -LRB- UAA -RRB- and the Hua - Hsia Association - a Taiwanese organization - organized the " Celebrating Oriental New Year " event .
To our surprise , over 10,000 visitors came for the performances , along with a number of leading politicians including Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and the mayor of Manukua .
The event took place outdoors in Howick Domain and lasted over five hours .
In addition to the Hua - Hsia Association , groups representing Korea , the Philippines , Malaysia and other Asian countries participated .
The stage was meticulously decorated , with Chinese lanterns hanging from the canopy and a scarlet imperial robe draped against the black backdrop , creating a very Chinese atmosphere .
There were folk dances performed in traditional Chinese costume , and towards the end , a spectacular dragon dance given by members of the Hua - Hsia Association .
The sound of gongs and drums filled the air , along with clapping and gasps of admiration from the audience .
Not many knew how much hard work had gone on behind the scenes for this successful cultural event .
Support from the then - representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New Zealand , R.C. Shih , was an important element in the event 's success .
The chairman of the UAA , Sharon Stewart , is a New Zealander who is very fond of Asian culture .
She holds regular seminars for new immigrants , and was recently awarded the Queen 's Service Medal in recognition of her dedication .
The UAA holds a " Celebrating Oriental New Year " event at this time every year as a way of encouraging cultural interchange , but every year it is a struggle to find co-sponsors willing to provide funding .
On this occasion , R.C. Shih 's support led to the event being jointly presented by the Hua - Hsia Association and the UAA .
With the Hua - Hsia Association 's committed support there were more than 30 snack booths present , giving the event the lively feel of a Chinese temple celebration .
The foreigners [ non-ethnic Chinese ] present were amazed in particular by the mass dragon dance that members of the Association performed .
A few years ago , when New Zealand was newly opened up to immigration and there were n't many Chinese around , hardly anyone had heard of the Hua - Hsia Association , and inviting government officials to attend such events was always fraught with difficulty .
As more and more Asian immigrants arrived , members of Parliament - vying for votes - began participating enthusiastically in the Association 's events .
The fact that the Association has supported charitable causes in New Zealand for many years , donating time and money , has been especially important in terms of getting taken seriously by the government , and it is thanks to the efforts of immigrants from Taiwan that successes like the New Year celebration have become possible .
For our family , it was our tenth year in New Zealand since arriving as immigrants .
Our daughter had just turned ten and our son was starting primary school when we came here .
During the tough years as new immigrants we overcame numerous difficulties of language and culture , working to establish ourselves in this foreign land .
We wanted our children to quickly adapt to the Western world but without forgetting their Chinese roots , so we endlessly reminded them that we will always be " descendants of the Yellow Emperor , " and urged them to merge into Western society with the characteristic tenacity and humanity of Chinese people .
When the UAA was first set up in 1995 , Sharon came to our house in need of assistance from the Chinese community , filled with enthusiasm but uncertain about how to make contact with the Chinese .
Our daughter has been Sharon 's pal ever since , and it was she who suggested that Sharon see R.C. Shih about a co-sponsor for this year 's New Year celebration .
Several weeks before the event Sharon asked me if I wanted to design a special garland to welcome the prime minister .
As a Howick resident and a floral designer , how could I refuse ?
I used scarlet silk cord and miniature embroidered Chinese slippers -LRB- as used in Chinese knotting -RRB- along with dried flowers , to make a red and gold garland .
As I put it on the premier I explained that these were lucky colors used for Chinese New Year .
She was delighted with this beautiful souvenir , rich in Chinese culture and art , and said she would keep it forever .
With the steady introduction of Chinese culture into this country , New Zealanders are generally more aware of Taiwan than before , and immigrants from Taiwan have been working hard to soften the anti-Asian sentiments of the locals .
When the program of New Year performances wrapped up , many New Zealand friends came forward to express their thanks , saying that they now felt more familiar with China and were eagerly looking forward to next year 's " Howick in the Park " !
