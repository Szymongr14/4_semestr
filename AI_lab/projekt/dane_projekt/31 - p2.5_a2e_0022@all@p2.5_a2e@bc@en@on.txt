I mean , this article reminds me also , doctor , of one of the articles that was mentioned with us in the program , I mean , uh , where it indicated that dividing the region after the Second World War was not successful .
I mean , we are witnessing today the repercussions of this division , which did not take into consideration sectarian geography , if the expression is right .
What is your comment ?
The reality is that the Sykes - Picot case , at that time , when it was set , only paid attention to the interests of the countries and the outcome , ah , uh , the balance of power among them , that is , between France in the first place and , and , and Britain or the United Kingdom .
But now , we see that there are divisions being confirmed inside the Arab countries .
In reality , they serve a -- the main , Israeli goal , which is to change the region into , ah , a mosaic of small countries based on denominational thinking , religious thinking , or sectarian thinking .
Yes .
So we see that what is happening in Iraq , in reality , ah , under the eyes and sight , the sights of the United States , which is -- occupying Iraq ; we see that Iraq might actually be divided into three districts , ah these areas agree to a great extent with the idea of sectarianism and factionism existing in Iraq .
Thank you very much .
And if %pw --
Go ahead , in brief , please .
Ah , no , I want to say that this tendency , there are efforts to expand it and generalize it in the region , or what is sometimes called Balkanizing the region like what happened , uh , after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the collapse of socialism in some countries of Western Europe .
Yes .
This is clear , thank you so much , Dr. Jawad Al Anani , and sorry about the tight time .
